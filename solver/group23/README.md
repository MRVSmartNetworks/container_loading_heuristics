# GROUP 23 - Ant Colony Optimization
The solution of the 3D bin packing problem is divided into three sub-problems:
1. 2D bin packing problem
2. Stacks creation
3. Vehicles decision rule

## 2D bin packing problem
This is the core of our solution and it is implemented using the ACO heuristic.
The main idea is to use as states the different stackability codes plus one additional states that is the empty vehicle state in order to construct the matrix containing the probability to move from one state to the other.
Moreover, the other two main components are the attractiveness matrix and the trail update matrix.
### Attractiveness
The matrix is build considering the space available in the choosen vehicle to enhance the stacks which dimensions better fit the available area.
### Trail update
The trail update considers the quality of the solutions generated by the ants. In our case the metric used to evaluate the goodness of a solution is ratio between the area occupied by the stacks and the total area of the vehicle. Moreover, a dynamic pheromone coefficient has been adopted; starting from a low value it increases as the area ratio becomes higher.

## Stacks creation
The stacks are created for the choosen vehicle before the call at the ACO heuristic.
*Note that there are some bugs when a stacks is composed of just one item for what concerns the constraints.*

## Vehicle decision rule
Up to now the vehicle is choosen statically just once at the beginning. The decision rule consists in choosing the best vehicle in terms of weight times volume over cost ratio.
*Note that this will not be the definitive choosing rule.*
